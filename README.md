# BMEC
BMEC is a collection of codes and scripts that have been utilized in various analysis stages during my research. This repository serves as a one-stop reference for methodologies ranging from scRNA-seq data processing to functional enrichment, genetic heritability, and cell-cell communication analysis.

# Features
scRNA-seq Data Processing: Code snippets and workflows for preprocessing and analyzing single-cell RNA sequencing data.
Functional Enrichment with Webgestalt: Automated scripts to facilitate functional enrichment analysis using Webgestalt.
Genetic Heritability with LDSC: Step-by-step guides and codes for leveraging LDSC for genetic heritability studies.
Cell-Cell Communication with CellChat: Scripts and workflows to uncover and analyze cell-to-cell communication dynamics using CellChat.
